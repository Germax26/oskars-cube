# Oskar's Cube

I originally saw this [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/1bvux0x/interesting_3d_maze_puzzle/). I wrote some code to get a graph of the state-space. From there I could see the path from the start to the end quite easily. I still want to clean this up as it is quite rushed and needs some improvement.
